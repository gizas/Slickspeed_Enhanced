Slickspeed_Enhanced
===================

Slickspeed_Enhanced

based on the Slickspeed implementation (https://github.com/kamicane/slickspeed/tree/master)
====================================================================================================

Slickspeed_Enhanced is an enhanced version of slickspeed test suite selector.

Slickspeed provides Speed / Validity tests for dom queries in JavaScript web frameworks.

Our implementation additionally provides:

1. Save your results on the server you run within a form. Organise and analyse you results later

2. Mobile support by saving results on your server 

3. Full list support with the most used JavaScript Libraries(JL) available at the time

4. A new analysed test-suite of selectors for full analysis for every JL. We provide a new group of 263 selectors !!!!
(We have extracted those selectors based on real stats from css sites)


In the imlementation we provide three diffrent implementations of Slickspeed_enhanced with different DOM size.
We have a small, medium and big DOM size for extensive analysis of each JL.
