Slickspeed_Enhanced and Slickspeed_Commands
===================
Slickspeed-Enhanced supports major Javascripts Libraries testing against selectors provided

Slickspeed-Commnads supports Javascripts Libraries testing against commands of JavaScript
The implementation includes jQuery commands but it can be extended to any other Javascript Library 
====================================================================================================

Both these Slickspeed_Enhanced ans Slickspeed_commands are an enhanced version of slickspeed test suite selector.

Slickspeed provides Speed / Validity tests for dom queries in JavaScript web frameworks.

Our implementations additionally provides:

1. Save your results on the server you run within a form. Organise and analyse you results later

2. Mobile support by saving results on your server 

3. Full list support with the most used JavaScript Libraries(JL) available at the time

4. A new analysed test-suite of selectors for full analysis for every JL. We provide a new group of 263 selectors !!!!
(We have extracted those selectors based on real stats from css sites)

In the implementation we provide three different implementations of Slickspeed_enhanced with different DOM size.
We have a small, medium and big DOM size for extensive analysis of each JL.
Moreover slickpseed_enhanced offers:

a)Ready selectors are provided for every dom size template. A full test bed for your future testing.
b)User can navigate just by typing sensitive urls throughout the implementation. In more details with:

1. By typing index.php?big you can navigate to big Dom size pages

2. By typing index.php?med can navigate to medium Dom size pages

3. By typing index.php?small can navigate to small Dom size pages


wherever you are, just for easier manipulation.


c)Alert messages inform user for test completion.

d)Form is enabled when tests are finished in order to save your results. 

e)Empty fields are checked when the user submits data. If no data or empty fields are being send an error message informs the user.

f)ShowResults.php summarises all result tests that have been saved per DOM size

g)With mouse over (in showResults.php) you can preview the results of the page.

h)Toggle button erases the unnecessary values from tests (in results.php files), in order to help extraction of data.
